# SPLP512
Semi-split low-profile 5x12 mechanical keyboard

Probably there are a few keyboards like this out there, but I prefer to make my own. As someone who has a Sofle keyboard and likes it a lot, I wanted to maintain the number and order of keys but in a more symmetrical layout and using just one PCB.

The microcontroller used is a Pro Micro.

It has 2 extra buttons: the first one for reset and the second one to change the different profiles.

It uses Choc V1 or V2 switches.

I'm currently working on the firmware and case.
