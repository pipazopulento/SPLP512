Semi split low profile 5x12 Mechanical keyboard

Probably there is a few keyboards like this out there but I prefer to make my own. As someone who has a sofle keyboard and like it a lot i wanted to mantain the number and order of keys but in a more simetrical layout and using just one pcb.

As microcontroller uses a pro micro

It has 2 extra buttons, the first one for reset and the second one changes the different profiles

It uses switches choc v1 or v2

And I'm currently working on the firmware and case
